	<h2>What is Biopsychosexual strength?</h2>

	<p>
		It is nature of the universe to level, flat out and degenerate all energy. Every human being is a biological sack of energy inhabitated by a soul. Biopsychosexual strength is the level of connectivity the soul has with the matter around it, specifically the corporial form of flesh, our bodies. Savouring and using our energy in ways we want is key.
	</p>

	<p>
		Biopsychosexual strength specifically refers to the psychological and biological framework your soul must adhear to. Degenerate thinking has long thought of the soul, consciousness and being to inhabit within the brain. This is in fact wrong. Being inhabits the entirety of the body from the tip of your hair to the depths of your testicles or ovaries. The different landmarks and functions of the human body are so intertwined with each other that it would be foolish to think the brain is a superior organ which is a master controller.
	</p>
	<p>
		Contempary thinking especially in western societies has shunned the notion of Biopsychosexual strength as an undesirable energy in modern civilisation. This is based on the falsehood that you are your pyschological thoughts. This is not true. You must remember that you are a soul beyond physical matter and psychological thoughts are manifestations of biological processes.
	</p>
	</p>
		To enjoy the bounty of life one must use the framework of the entire body and not just the brain. To do this you must strengthen your Biopsychosexual energies. In layman's terms this means following your body just as much as you follow your brain.
	</p>

	<h2>How can I increase my Biopsychosexual strength?</h2>

	<p>
		Growing Biopsychosexual strength is best habituated in direct natural sunlight wearing as little clothing as possible. This is because of the understanding that the Sun plays to our souls. The Sun is the father of energies in our reality. It is our God. Nakedness strengths your Biopsychosexual strength by making your soul aware more of the body it inhabits.
	</p>

	<h3>Below are some philosophical ideas which go well with Biopsychosexual strength development</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Behave and think honestly to yourself and others. Lies are a pollution which repress reality.
			</li>
			<li>
				Do not fear primitive thoughts of sex and violence. Be aware when your brain tries to limit these thoughts as uncivil.
			</li>
			<li>
				You may interpret religion as you will but do not worship any God other than the Sun our father.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many souls are in constant battle to take energy from other souls. Do not expose yourself to vampiric energies. These are often from people, news, political opinions that inhibit your Biopsychosexual strength development or pollute your psychology framework which makes it harder for your soul to work with.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>True freedom; your soul free to fulfill the bounty in life.</li>
		<li>A better framework for reality. Balance between the psychological and biological framework allows for easier manipulation by the soul.</li>
		<li>Better connectivity between souls. Some souls take energy and others share it and like to give energies to others. Those with strong Biopsychosexual strength no longer gravitate towards souls but have souls gravitate towards them.
